*March 16th
*For this project we had to make a logo so for my design i just kind of did whatever came to mind first, which happened to be a weird red hand with an eye in the middle of it that looks like a monsters hand or something of the sort. I like this design because it can look good on whatever scale you have to put it on which is important for a logo it will still look cool as a little button as it would on a giant poster or even a t shirt.
*I designed everything for it with figma and then turned it into an SVG file and then used the links tony provided to complete the project
